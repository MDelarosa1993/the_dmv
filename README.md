# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.


1. Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
The step I dug into the codebase was I went through the files and kinda got a gist of what it was and did. I ran rspec and went to the first fail and worked my way down. Fixing failures brought up more failures but with this process I was able to fix and pass all the test that were failing.
2. What was hard about working with code you did not write?
One of the biggest things was thought process, I didn't know where to start or what file was created first.
3. What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
Passing the tests and tracking down the failed tests was easier than I thought. The failed messages had the line that failed and what is needed to fix it.
